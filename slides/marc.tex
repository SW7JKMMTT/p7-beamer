                %Conclusion --> Not really a lot tbh
                %SQL vs NoSQL?? Should be fairly well covered by Jesper

                %Also consider rewards in this -> rewards for tests, rewards for front--end development, reeward for emulating > creating data provider
                %Adhering to scalability - a lot is internal development and is only recognizeable in the source code.

            \item<2-> Stakeholder
            %Focus here on theoretical, and why - what would be the benefit? with such benefit why did we not have one.(tried, got 1 response late on)
            \item<3-> Development Focus
            %What should be the focus for this segment? the bases should be fairly well covered, and so should why

    \subsection{Project Outcome}
    %Maybe add a conclusion segment?? What to sum up in the conclusion would rely on covereage by the others, is there even value in this?
    \begin{frame}{Project Outcome}\framesubtitle{}   
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Enunciate
            %Graphics/Show example??
            %Needs graphics, show and explain why this works as a UI for developers(can be related to IOT concept if done correct)
            \item<2-> Benefits of Development Strategy
            \begin{itemize}
                \item<2-> Testing

            %The rewards acquired from our development process concepts, test, Front-End Prototype, Emulating data provider over developing one
            %Tests helps us acquire code quality and the regression tests makes it easy to identify problems for further development.
            %Our load tests have given us some performance numbers, these numbers can be used to evaluate scalability for a client, laying the groundwork for a scalability analysis.
            %The few faults that exists we know why they exist because of rigerous testing(Jesper mentioned some), and aside from those we are confident that the system works, as a result of our tests running successfully.
            \item<3-> Scalability
            \begin{itemize}
                \item<3-> Scalability Testing
                %didnt do this, requires stakeholder
                \item<3-> Functional Scalability
                %Testing this would be qualitative testing which cannot really be measured, no test have been executed but this is a concept we have tried to achieve through low coupling and pattern usage
            \end{itemize}
            %Perhaps simply focus on scalability measures not related to Load Scalability - that way it also fits the theme of this segment
            %Opsummer Sass quick, evaluate - wouldÂ´be evaluated upon stakeholder criteria which we do not have.
            %Framework for func scale
