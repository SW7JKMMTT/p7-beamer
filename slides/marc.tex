        \begin{itemize}
            \item Major Choices
                %Discuss the most impactful choices during development
                %No stakeholder
                %Lorry Driver foucs --> why it didnt do shit
                %Conclusion --> Not really a lot tbh
                %SQL vs NoSQL?? Should be fairly well covered by Jesper
            \begin{itemize}
                    \item Focus Group
                    \item Stakeholder 
                    \item Development Focus
            \end{itemize}
            \item The Result
                %Show Enunciate
                %Relate to "internet of things concept" (JSON platform independant promotes this through rest API -> excellent choice!)
                %Ponder the use of this for developers and whether this could be released or a baseline front--end is required
                %Also consider rewards in this -> rewards for tests, rewards for front--end development, reeward for emulating > creating data provider
                %Adhering to scalability - a lot is internal development and is only recognizeable in the source code.
            \item Future Work
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Server \& API Improvements
                \item Additional Development
                %Consider what it would require to prepare a release worthy product, producer client for one - why?

    \subsection{Major Choices}
    \begin{frame}[t]{Major Choices}\framesubtitle{Work Partioning}    
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Focus Group
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Military Logistic Division
                \item Lorry Drivers
                \item Postal Services
                \item Transport Services
            \end{itemize}
            \item Stakeholder
            %Focus here on theoretical, and why - what would be the benefit? with such benefit why did we not have one.(tried, got 1 response late on)
            \item Development Focus
            %What should be the focus for this segment? the bases should be fairly well covered, and so should why
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Data Provider
                \item Server
                \item Consumer Client
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \subsection{The Result}
    %Maybe add a conclusion segment?? What to sum up in the conclusion would rely on covereage by the others, is there even value in this?
    \begin{frame}[t]{The Result}\framesubtitle{}   
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Internet of Things
            %Quickly go through the concept and relate to our project
            \item Enunciate
            %Graphics/Show example??
            %Needs graphics, show and explain why this works as a UI for developers(can be related to IOT concept if done correct)
            \item Rewards(title in progress)
            %The rewards acquired from our development process concepts, Testing, Front End Prototype, Emulating data provider over developing one
            %How much of this is covered by Sass?
            \item Scalability
            %Follow up on Jesper i suppose? content will depend on his covereage
            %Perhaps simply focus on scalability measures not related to Load Scalability if Jesper focuses on that - that way it also fits the theme of this segment
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \subsection{Future Work}
    \begin{frame}[t]{Future Work}\framesubtitle{Future Work for the REST API}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Server \& API Improvements
            %Content will depend on Jespers coverage of thsi
            %Additional Software Scalability(what we simply thought of as performance)
            \begin{itemize}
                    \item TBD
            \end{itemize}
            \item Additional Development
            \begin{itemize}
                    \item Producer Client
                    %Necessary
                    \item Consumer Client
