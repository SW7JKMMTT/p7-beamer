            \item Major Choices
                %Discuss the most impactful choices during development
                %No stakeholder
                %Lorry Driver foucs --> why it didnt do shit
                %Conclusion --> Not really a lot tbh
                %SQL vs NoSQL?? Should be fairly well covered by Jesper
            \begin{itemize}
                    \item Focus Group
                    \item Stakeholder

            \item Project Outcome
                %Show Enunciate
                %Ponder the use of this for developers and whether this could be released or a baseline front--end is required
                %Also consider rewards in this -> rewards for tests, rewards for front--end development, reeward for emulating > creating data provider
                %Adhering to scalability - a lot is internal development and is only recognizeable in the source code.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item User Interface(enunciate)

                \item Additional Development
                %Consider what it would require to prepare a release worthy product, producer client for one - why?

    \subsection{Major Choices}
    \begin{frame}{Major Choices}\framesubtitle{Work Partioning}    
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Focus Group
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Military Logistic Division
                \item Lorry Drivers
                \item Postal Services
                \item Transport Services
            \end{itemize}
            \item Stakeholder
            %Focus here on theoretical, and why - what would be the benefit? with such benefit why did we not have one.(tried, got 1 response late on)
            \item Development Focus
            %What should be the focus for this segment? the bases should be fairly well covered, and so should why
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Data Provider
                \item Server
                \item Consumer Client
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \subsection{Project Outcome}
    %Maybe add a conclusion segment?? What to sum up in the conclusion would rely on covereage by the others, is there even value in this?
    \begin{frame}{Project Outcome}\framesubtitle{}   
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Enunciate
            %Graphics/Show example??
            %Needs graphics, show and explain why this works as a UI for developers(can be related to IOT concept if done correct)
            \item Rewards(title in progress)
            %The rewards acquired from our development process concepts, test, Front-End Prototype, Emulating data provider over developing one
            %Tests helps us acquire code quality and the regression tests makes it easy to identify problems for further development.
            %Our load tests have given us some performance numbers, these numbers can be used to evaluate scalability for a client, laying the groundwork for a scalability analysis.
            %The few faults that exists we know why they exist because of rigerous testing(Jesper mentioned some), and aside from those we are confident that the system works, as a result of our tests running successfully.
            \item Scalability
            %Perhaps simply focus on scalability measures not related to Load Scalability - that way it also fits the theme of this segment
            %Opsummer Sass quick, evaluate - wouldÂ´be evaluated upon stakeholder criteria which we do not have.
            %Framework for func scale
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Future Work}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Server \& API Improvements
            %Additional Software Scalability(what we simply thought of as performance)
            \begin{itemize}
                    \item Adative time between requests
                    %adaptive requests --- time between requests per driver based on server traffic.
                    \item Long polling.
                    \item Sharding. %DAO, XML config, Hibernate
                    \item Expand on Services
            \end{itemize}
            \item Additional Development
            \begin{itemize}
                    \item Producer Client
                    %Necessary, library as MVP, but producer support is required
                    \item Consumer Client
                    %Not necessary
